    <h1>The Quiet Power of Funke</h1>
    <p>“Does anyone have questions’’? The speaker’s voice jolted Funke back to training room. She had questions but she would rather freeze to death at the North Pole than stand to speak.</p>
    <p>Funke rarely spoke up in meetings. She was shy, she was restrained and quiet and thoughtful and she believed her quiet voice didn’t carry weight in a world that rewarded loudness.</p>
    <p>She admired her brother’s wife, Eunice. Eunice was the VP of a Fintech Company in Lagos. Eunice was always speaking to an audience with confidence and charm. No fear. Just confidence. She wanted to be that. She wanted to speak up without fear.</p>
    <p>Funke also saw how people shivered and shrunk around loud and aggressive people, knowing she could never be that but desiring to lead calmly and not see people scared for their lives in her presence.</p>
    <p>Then she started practicing calm assertiveness. She stopped stuttering. She stopped over-explaining. She stopped speaking too fast. Then, People began to listen.</p>
    <p>What happened? Hell did not freeze over. Instead, she started gaining respect and that respect was Instant. She became confident and gained the admiration of other people.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to shout to be confident or powerful.</p>
    <p>We are learning how to be softly powerful—and how calm is not weakness, but quiet strength. Join the conversation and our community of women rewriting the rules.</p>
